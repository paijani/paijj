Description: The package includes 2 functions: missing_gone and imp_methods. 
    Missing_gone removes variables that have a certain percentage of missing values. The percentage of missing values that determine
    whether the variable will be removed or not is set by the user. Imp_methods will provide user with options of imputation methods by 
    mice, based on whether they want to impute a  nominal, ordinal, continuous, binary, level 1 or level 2 variable.
